# Clef

**Clef** (/kle/) is an experimental, decentralized communication platform
designed as a privacy-first alternative to Discord.

Clef provides familiar real-time features — servers, channels, roles, private messages, and multi-device sync —
while rejecting centralization, surveillance, and opaque authority.

The goal is simple:
**make secure, decentralized communication feel obvious.**

---

## Core Pillars

Clef is built on three non-negotiable principles:

- **Decentralization that works**  
  Anyone can run an instance. No central authority. No privileged servers.

- **Privacy by construction**  
  All user content is end-to-end encrypted. Instances cannot read messages, media, or profiles.

- **Simplicity for users**  
  One identity, seamless multi-device usage, instant history access when authorized — without exposing infrastructure complexity.

## Why “Clef”?

A *clef* is a key — not the music itself, but what makes it readable.

In Clef:

- **structure is visible**
- **meaning is private**
- **access is granted by possession, not trust**

The name reflects the project’s core idea:
**keys unlock communication, but infrastructure never owns it.**

## Project Philosophy

Clef is guided by two complementary documents:

- 📜 **[Manifesto](./manifestos/manifesto.md)**  
  The vision, values, and goals of the project.

- 🛠 **[Technical Manifesto](./manifestos/technical-manifesto.md)**  
  The architectural principles that guarantee decentralization, privacy, and usability.

These documents define what Clef *must* be — and what it must never become.

## Contributing

Clef is fully open-source and community-driven.

Anyone is welcome to contribute — code, design, documentation, or discussion —
as long as contributions respect the project’s architectural principles.

Before contributing, please read:

➡️ **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)**

All technical and architectural decisions are discussed openly.
